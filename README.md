# 3js_React_Raycasting_Character_Demo
This is an old project I did in 2020 to try Rayasting on webGL. 
I'm working on upating the code for latest react and packages and making the post processing work again. 

Post processing not working right now. (It worked 5 years ago.)

How to Run:
open a command prompt, and run
1. yarn
2. yarn start
